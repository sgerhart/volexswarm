Overview
VolexSwarm is an autonomous, AI-driven crypto trading platform powered by modular agents. Each agent specializes in a specific trading domain â€” from research and signal generation to execution and compliance. The system is built for high-frequency, low-latency decision-making, continuous self-optimization, and fully autonomous operation, with a Meta-Agent coordinating workflows. Secure key management is handled by Vault, and real-time and historical data is managed in TimescaleDB.
A human operator can optionally interact with the system via a Web UI or CLI to issue high-level commands (e.g., "Sell 100 ETH"), though all decision-making is fully automated by default.

Objectives
	â€¢	Fully autonomous crypto trading with modular, cooperative AI agents
	â€¢	Natural language command interface via Meta-Agent
	â€¢	Backtest-before-live strategy pipeline with continuous self-optimization
	â€¢	Secure storage of secrets with Vault
	â€¢	Web UI for monitoring, performance visualization, and overrides

Agent Roles
Agent Name
Responsibility

Strategy
Propose, refine, and backtest trade strategies
Execution
Execute trades securely through ccxt or native exchange APIs
Risk Manager
Enforce stop-loss, exposure limits, position sizing
Compliance
Audit and log decisions, enforce trading policy
Backtest
Run historical backtests across strategy configurations
Optimize
Tune hyperparameters, assess strategy performance
Monitor
Health-checks, trading anomalies, trade syncing
Meta-Agent
Coordinate agents, accept user commands, and manage decisions

Technologies
	â€¢	Language: Python (Cursor IDE)
	â€¢	Agent Framework: CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph / custom async
	â€¢	Crypto Integration: ccxt (exchange SDK)
	â€¢	Secrets: HashiCorp Vault (KV v2), fully API-driven
	â€¢	Data Storage: PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB (trades, logs, backtests)
	â€¢	Agent Comms: Redis or Kafka (future)
	â€¢	UI: Streamlit (prototype) or Next.js (future full version)
	â€¢	Containerization: Docker + Docker Compose

System Architecture
	â€¢	Vault stores all secrets, accessed by agents via common/vault.py
	â€¢	TimescaleDB stores historical trade data, backtest results, logs
	â€¢	Agents are deployed in containers and coordinate via Meta-Agent
	â€¢	Meta-Agent accepts human commands and routes tasks to other agents
	â€¢	Web UI displays trading activity, strategy testing, and agent insights
	â€¢	Backup/Restore scripts manage Vault snapshots and Timescale data

MVP Plan
Phase
Goal
âœ… Phase 1
Core folder structure, Vault & DB containers, test backups
ðŸ”„ Phase 2
Implement common/vault.py, common/db.py, test access
ðŸ”œ Phase 3
Execution agent (ccxt integration, test orders, dry run)
ðŸ”œ Phase 4
Signal agent (TA/ML signals using live or cached data)
ðŸ”œ Phase 5
Backtesting agent with metrics export to DB and logs
ðŸ”œ Phase 6
Meta-agent + natural language interface (CLI or HTTP)
ðŸ”œ Phase 7
Web UI with dashboard, performance, command input

Web UI Capabilities
	â€¢	Strategy visualizations (PnL, sharpe, win rate)
	â€¢	Real-time portfolio, trade log, open orders
	â€¢	Logs and audit trail by agent
	â€¢	Chat box or command form to talk to Meta-Agent
	â€¢	Kill switch / emergency override

Security
	â€¢	All API keys and DB credentials in Vault
	â€¢	No secrets in .env or plain text
	â€¢	Manual confirmation flow for large trades
	â€¢	Read-only and withdrawal-protected API keys

Interaction Example
[You] > "Sell 100 ETH"
[Meta-Agent] Validating signalâ€¦ confirming exposureâ€¦
[Risk Agent] âœ… Limit within bounds
[Execution Agent] ðŸŸ¢ Order sent to Binance
[Compliance] ðŸ“œ Logged 100 ETH SELL at $3,450
